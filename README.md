# tcp-mitm-proxy
A proxy app that prints out data between a TCP connection

I built this primarily for listening to connections between game client and server. It should work for any game based on TCP provided that you route the game servers host name (not ip address) to localhost in the hosts file.

It should work with any game with a little bit of tinkering
